            Grammy®-nominated music video director Cooper Roberts makes his feature directorial debut with horror-comedy All You Need Is Blood.
            All You Need Is Blood debuts exclusively on the KINO Studio app on October 12. The film will be available across VOD outlets following the KINO premiere.
            Logan Riley Bruner (Stranger Things), Neel Sethi (The Jungle Book) and newcomer Emma Chasse star alongside Mena Suvari (American Pie) and comedian Eddie Griffin (Undercover Brother) in the “blood-soaked, heartfelt” zombie-comedy.
            The film follows “Bucky, a 16-year-old aspiring director who dreams of becoming the next arthouse auteur sensation. After a strange meteor crash lands in his backyard and turns his deadbeat father into a brain-eating zombie, Bucky and his friends seize the opportunity to create the ultimate horror flick, starring his undead dad. 
            They&apos;ll soon realize that making a movie with real zombies is harder than they thought, especially when Bucky can&apos;t tolerate the sight of blood.
